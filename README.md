# PA-LLM

Automating LLM Querying for Biomedical Text Processing

## TL;DR
In this one-week hackathon project, we aim to leverage cutting-edge LLM capabilities to improve readability and understandability of medical texts in the format of annotations. Our primary focus will be on automating queries to different LLM via a REST-service to provide summaries, text simplifications, and translations of passages from existing biomedical texts. The overarching goal is to enhance accessibility, comprehension, and knowledge sharing, within the medical and healthcare communities, but also make medical information available to lay people.

## Project Goals
REST-service: Develop an automated system that sends requests an LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BARD) for biomedical text processing.
Implement a functionality to generate concise and coherent summaries of passages from biomedical documents. These summaries will be vital for quick information retrieval.
Implement a functionality to simplify complex medical jargon, making it more understandable for a broader audience, including patients and non-specialists.
Incorporate translation capabilities to provide content in multiple languages for a more global and inclusive approach to medical information.
Register the REST-service in existing infrastructure such as PubAnnotation to allow automated generation of summaries, simplifications and translations, and store them as annotation for respective paragraphs.
Evaluate the quality of summaries and translations, leveraging the international participants of the hackathon.
Provide a web-interface for user-friendliness and for a feedback-loop to enable quality control and system refinement based on user feedback during the hackathon and after.

## Suitability for BLAH
This hackathon project presents an opportunity to harness the capabilities of LLMs to enhance the accessibility and comprehensibility of biomedical texts. By creating a user-friendly system that generates summaries, simplifies text, and offers translations, we aim to improve the knowledge sharing and communication within the medical community and beyond.
Furthermore, we hope that by proposing a relatively simple project, we can attract collaborators with different backgrounds that can offer their help in programming, UX or evaluation of the generated summaries and translations.
